# K8unrealGameserver

game servers on Debian 10 with Unreal Engine 5, running on a GCP Kubernetes cluster, open to the public, with load balancing.

Steps

Step 1: Set up your GCP account and project
Create a GCP account and set up billing.
Create a new project in the GCP Console.
Step 2: Set up the Google Cloud SDK and Terraform
Install the Google Cloud SDK.
Install Terraform.
Step 3: Set up the Kubernetes cluster
Create a new Kubernetes cluster on GCP using the gcloud command-line tool.
Set up kubectl to manage your cluster.
Step 4: Create a Docker image for your game server
Write a Dockerfile that installs Debian 10, Unreal Engine 5, and your game server.
Build the Docker image and upload it to a container registry.
Step 5: Create the Kubernetes deployment
Write a Kubernetes deployment file that deploys your Docker image to the cluster.
Set the number of replicas to 3.
Step 6: Create the Kubernetes service and ingress
Write a Kubernetes service file that exposes your deployment to the cluster.
Write a Kubernetes ingress file that exposes your service to the public.
Use the GCP load balancer to route traffic to your game servers.
Step 7: Use Terraform to automate deployment
Write a Terraform configuration file that sets up the GCP resources required for your cluster, deployment, service, and ingress.
Use the Terraform CLI to apply your configuration.
Here's some example Terraform code that you can use as a starting point for your deployment:

graphql
Copy code
# Configure the GCP provider
provider "google" {
  project = "my-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

# Configure the Kubernetes provider
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_context_cluster = "gke_my-project_us-central1_my-cluster"
}

# Create the Kubernetes deployment
resource "kubernetes_deployment" "game-server" {
  metadata {
    name = "game-server"
  }

  spec {
    replicas = 3

    selector {
      match_labels = {
        app = "game-server"
      }
    }

    template {
      metadata {
        labels = {
          app = "game-server"
        }
      }

      spec {
        container {
          image = "gcr.io/my-project/game-server:latest"
          name  = "game-server"
          ports {
            container_port = 7777
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Create the Kubernetes service
resource "kubernetes_service" "game-server" {
  metadata {
    name = "game-server"
  }

  spec {
    selector = {
      app = "game-server"
    }

    port {
      name = "game-server"
      port = 7777
    }

    type = "ClusterIP"
  }
}

# Create the Kubernetes ingress
resource "kubernetes_ingress" "game-server" {
  metadata {
    name = "game-server"
    annotations = {
      "kubernetes.io/ingress.class" = "gce"
    }
  }

  spec {
    rule {
      http {
        path {
          backend {
            service_name = kubernetes_service.game-server.metadata.0.name
            service_port = "game-server"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

# Configure the GCP load balancer
resource "google_compute_global_forwarding_rule" "game-server" {
  name       = "game-server"
 



Sure, here are the steps to create a new Kubernetes cluster on GCP using the gcloud command-line tool and to set up kubectl to manage the cluster:

Open a terminal window and make sure you have the gcloud command-line tool installed on your system. You can install it by following the instructions on the Google Cloud SDK installation page.

Log in to your Google Cloud account by running the following command and following the prompts:

Copy code
gcloud auth login
Set your default project by running the following command:

python
Copy code
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
Replace PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project in which you want to create the Kubernetes cluster.

Create a new Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

css
Copy code
gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME --zone=ZONE --num-nodes=3
Replace CLUSTER_NAME with a name for your new cluster, ZONE with the zone in which you want to create the cluster, and NUM_NODES with the number of nodes you want in the cluster.

gcloud container clusters create my-kubernetes-cluster --zone=us-central1-a --num-nodes=3


Once the cluster has been created, get the credentials for the cluster by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
gcloud container clusters get-credentials CLUSTER_NAME --zone=ZONE
Replace CLUSTER_NAME and ZONE with the same values you used when creating the cluster.

Verify that you can connect to the cluster by running the following command:

csharp
Copy code
kubectl get nodes
This should display a list of the nodes in your cluster.

That's it! You should now have a new Kubernetes cluster on GCP and be able to manage it using kubectl.
